## Why  
This was my entry to Hyper Island's application task 2019, on the theme "Bridge the gap".

## What  
What if there was a place on the internet where you used your anonymity for something good?  
This site is a place where you get a positive boost, allowing anyone to write a message as long as it is positive.  

## How  
Every message is analyzed before being published on the page using the [Perspective API](https://www.perspectiveapi.com).
